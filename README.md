# WWDC-15
My (winning) scholarship application for WWDC 2015. Created in roughly 12 hours (straight) because I decided to scrap my previous one the morning before the deadline..

I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty ridiculously excited to be heading to San Fran to actually be there this year having watched along online from home for a good few years!

See you all on June 8th!
